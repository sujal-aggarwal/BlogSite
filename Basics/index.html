					<p>
						Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also
						governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over
						decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than
						their founders expect.
					</p>

					<p>
						Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for
						different purposes. Thus, some static do’s and don’ts are always of
						use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has
						three common features: maintainability, dependability, and
						usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even
						in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few
						prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid
						foundation on which readable code can be written.
					</p>

					<h2 class="h-style">PREREQUISITES</h2>

					<p>
						This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these,
						a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites
						that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like
						design and architecture. An important question is how development is
						structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The
						problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the
						developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such
						basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being
						written.
					</p>

					<p>
						Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design
						and architecture. Either a code is so simple that there are
						obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no
						obvious errors. Software design is also of importance to clients,
						who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If
						there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then
						those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed design is
						a good guide for coding.
					</p>

					<p>
						The next step is to measure existing programming languages against
						the requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed
						routine can be adopted.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established
						good coding practices.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">COMMENTING</h3>
							<p>
								Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
								programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
								programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge
								transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description
								of the module, original author, modifications and authors who
								modified code with a description on why it was modified were
								components of an early commenting practice.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
							<p>
								Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding.
								Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not
								replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion
								and utter waste of time, descriptive names should be used.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
							<p>
								The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain
								result, developers may use complex logic but this should be
								minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses
								the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even
								completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple code
								does not always depend on the length of the code. The code must
								also be conceptually simple. An added advantage is if the code
								is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and
								programmer keystrokes can be reduced.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">PORTABILITY</h3>
							<p>
								Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code
								contains values referring to ‘absolute parameters’ such as file
								names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is
								of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize these
								variables and configure them so the application can also be run
								and maintained in a different environment.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">TESTING</h3>
							<p>
								Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test
								cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they
								are developed while an application is coded.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
							<p>
								While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors
								throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be
								debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck
								for longer programmes. The best practice, therefore, is to debug
								each module as soon as it has been created.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3 class="h-style">DEPLOYMENT</h3>
							<p>
								Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
								installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated
								regularly. Unused code or anything that is not necessary should
								not be installed.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce
						risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of
						these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled
						programmer writing numerous codes, all these guidelines will come in
						handy. Since codes can run up to millions of lines at times,
						outdated advice like ‘keep it simple’ or ‘less is more’ is priceless
						and should always be remembered.
